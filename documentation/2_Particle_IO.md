Step Two: Power up Particle.io
===

1. Get yourself a [Particle.io](https://www.particle.io/) account
2. Open their [Console](https://console.particle.io/devices) and register your Photon ÂµC - **note down the Device ID**
3. Open their [IDE](https://build.particle.io/build) and paste in the code you can find in [particle_code.ino](https://github.com/d-Rickyy-b/Monzo-Meter/blob/master/particle.io/device_code.ino)
4. Save your code and **note the Access Token**. In the python code it's called *particle_token*
