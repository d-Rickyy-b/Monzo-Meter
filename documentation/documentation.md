This instruction was made for building a custom "Monzo-Meter" - a small device for showing your current balance of your Monzo bank account. This idea comes from Simon Vans-Colina - he thought about a problem everyone seems to know:
>One particular piece of information that's important to just about everyone, is *“how much of my pay is still in my bank account”*.

This documentation provides you with all the code. All you need is the hardware. It is divided into six major parts you'll find below.

You may see references to "Mondo" throughout this and linked documentation.  Mondo changed it's name to Monzo in early 2017.

Credits are going to [Simon Vans-Colina](https://medium.com/@simonvc) and his amazing instructions in [his article](https://medium.com/@simonvc/the-internet-of-things-that-connect-to-your-bank-account-ab8a6a2a44d7) which gave us the idea for this project.

**Disclaimer**: Monzo is currently only available in the UK.  You will need either a prepaid or current account with Monzo to complete this project. Please also mind, that the code & instructions *were made for the current account*. For prepaid accounts minor changes are to be made.
