Step Zero: Buying the Hardware
===

Here's a list of things you'll need:
- [Photon ÂµC](https://store.particle.io/) (19$) - You can buy the Photon with or without headers, I bought the one with headers so that I could mock the project up on breadboard first
- 9g digital micro servo (anologue wont work and beware of knock offs on eBay which either aren't digital even though they say they are or suffer from constant "flutter" - I had good results with this one http://www.servoshop.co.uk/index.php?pid=SG90G&area=Servo
- Power supply - I used a standard iPhone wall adapter with a USB Type A to USB Micro B lead
- Gauge Hardware - This one is up to you, in our example we purchased a fuel guage from eBay, removed the internals and refitted our hardware into the housing.  Alternatively, you could mount it all in a small project box or 3D print your own housing.
- Sundries - If you bought the Photon with headers you will need a small breadboard and some Dupont male to male jumper wires. If not, some wire, a soldering iron and some solder.  Some general handtools will also be required and a hot glue gun will come in handy.
