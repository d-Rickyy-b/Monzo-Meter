Step One: Wiring up the Hardware
===

The servo has three wires:
- Red - Power
- Brown - Ground
- Orange - Data

Connect them to the Photon as follows:
- Red - VIN
- Brown - GND
- Orange - A4

Connect the Photon to your power supply to the on-board USB Micro B Connector.

If you got a nice housing, put it in there - check the images below.
