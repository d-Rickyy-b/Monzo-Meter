Monzo-Meter
===
This repository is all about building your own Monzo-Meter. It's a little device to monitor your Monzo account's balance.

All you need is about **1-3 hours time** (depending on your skills), the **hardware**, and the **instructions** you can find [here](https://github.com/d-Rickyy-b/Monzo-Meter/blob/master/documentation/documentation.md).

### Need help?
